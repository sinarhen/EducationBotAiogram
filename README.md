## Project Architecture
Project functionality is separated between 2 folders: handlers and db
![image](https://github.com/sinarhen/EducationBotAiogram/assets/105736826/375fb70f-d496-4885-b922-91514dee2423)

Utilities folders:
- '<root>/utils/' contains some general utils along the project  
- '<root>/plots/' contains some generated images of tables (i know, it is probably the worst solution in case of large-scale usage)
- 'keyboards/keyboards.py' contains generated with aiogram.types.ReplyKeyboardMarkup

Files in root of the project:
- 'config.py' contains the path to absolute location of the project for automatic creation of education.sqlite3, api_token from .env information for correct creation files in the root of the directory
- 'bot.py' functionality to start the bot, collecting all the project message handlers, and registering them with aiogram.register_message_handler(**handler_name**) and start the polling
- 'create_bot.py' functionality to create the bot.Bot(**api_token**) instance and dispatcher for further using it in **bot.py**
- 'requirements.txt' requirements for venv for quick installation all of the necessary packages

### Handlers
![image](https://github.com/sinarhen/EducationBotAiogram/assets/105736826/a930b157-4cbf-4b46-8fe6-69a393734c6b)

handlers contain 2 folders: 
- 'admin/' - handlers for admin panel (admin_accounts, admin_homework) 
- 'client/' - handlers for basic user (schedule, books, homework, and one another folder 'accounts/' with class of User model for better validation and adding to db)

**See detailed at**: *https://github.com/sinarhen/EducationBotAiogram/edit/master/handlers/client*

Each handler is working with their according database manager from '<root>/db/' folder (will be described below) 

#### Example of usage:

```python
from db.client.books.books_db_manager import BooksDB

initializer = BooksDB()
lessons = initializer.get_all_lessons()
authors = initializer.get_all_authors()
```

This code initializes Database Manager for Books table in database
